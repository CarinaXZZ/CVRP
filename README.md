This problem aims to find the shortest possible route for the trucks to deliver the goods to all the shops. The capacity of the truck is limit. There are 249 shops. And the capacity of each truck is 500.
Using evolutionary algorithms to find the best route for the capacitated vehicle. 
The solution of this problem was evaluated by the cost of the distance and time to find the solution. The cost reach 5984 which is the best-so-far cost in this project. 25 trucks are used to in the best route. And it takes about 15 minutes to find the solution.
